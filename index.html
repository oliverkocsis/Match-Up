            <p>Match Up, also known as Concentration, Match Match, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso or
                simply Pairs, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards
                are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.
                The game ends when the last pair has been picked up.</p>

            <p> It is a particularly good game for young children, though adults may find it challenging and
                stimulating as well. The scheme is often used in quiz shows and can be employed as an educational
                game.</p>

            <p>Match Up may be played solo either as a leisurely exercise, or with the following scoring method:
                play as normal, but keep track of the number of non-matching pairs turned over. The object is to
                clear the tableau in the fewest turns, or to get the lowest possible score.
            </p>
            <p>Over the course of the game, it becomes known where certain cards are located, and so upon turning
                up one card, players with good memory will be able to remember where they have already seen its
                pair.
            </p>
            <p>It is common for many players to think they know where pairs are and to turn over the one they are
                sure of first, then be stumped finding its mate. A better strategy is to turn over a less certain
                card first, so that if wrong, one knows not to bother turning a more certain card over.
            </p>
            <p>Hardly any other game is so successful at bringing players of all ages to the same table. The game
                is amazingly easy to play, connects generations, creates common ground and is always tremendous fun.
            </p>
            <p>So many people know and love the classic game. The legendary memory game was first played in 1959,
                and since then has been constantly reinvented. Whether it features colourful pictures from the world
                of children's experiences, art from famous museums or as an app or online game, the memory cards
                remain in people's minds because of the happy memories playing the game creates.
            </p>
            <p>Pick a card, turn it over â€“ and discover the hidden picture! Every game is an exciting voyage of
                discovery, and we want to help everyone create happy memories of playing the game.</p>
