# Create an archive of your app

https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/devf37a1db04

Create an archive of your app to upload it to App Store Connect or export it for distribution outside of the App Store.

1. In the main window, choose a target from the Scheme toolbar menu.

For iOS, tvOS, and watchOS apps, choose a generic device—Generic iOS Device, Generic tvOS Device, or Generic iOS Device + watchOS Device—or choose your device name from the Scheme toolbar menu. If a device is connected to your Mac, the device name appears in the Scheme toolbar menu. When you disconnect the device, the menu item changes to the generic device name.

Important: You can’t create an archive if the device is set to a simulator.

2. Choose Product > Archive.

If the archive builds successfully, it appears in the Archives organizer.

3. To open the Archives organizer, choose Window > Organizer and click Archives.

# Troubleshoot
In case of error, uncheck Auto sign off in General tab, then archive, then check again and archive.
